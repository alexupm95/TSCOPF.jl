    _timestamped_results_dir(path_results) -> String

Timestamped run directory (`:` stripped for Windows paths), **claimed atomically**.

The name has second resolution. Two runs that finish inside the same second — routine
for ED/DC-OPF sweeps and for the test suite — would otherwise resolve to the same
folder and silently interleave their outputs: `Inputs/`, `Dispatch/CSV/` and the dual
exports become a union of both runs, with same-named files overwritten by whichever
finished last.

The directory is therefore claimed with `mkdir`, which **fails** if the path already
exists, and a ` (2)`, ` (3)`, … suffix is appended until the claim succeeds. Because
`mkdir` is atomic on both Windows and POSIX, this is also correct for concurrent
sweeps running in separate processes, not just sequential runs in one session.

The common case is unchanged: a run that gets its own second keeps the plain
`Results - yyyy-mm-dd HHMMSS` name, so existing frozen baselines and the paths quoted
in the docs stay valid. Suffixes are assigned in creation order, so chronological
sorting still holds within a second.
