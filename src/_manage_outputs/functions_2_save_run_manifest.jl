 functions_2_save_run_manifest.jl  —  machine-readable description of one run
================================================================================
 `run_manifest.toml` sits at the root of every results folder and answers, without
 any Julia in the loop, the question "what exactly produced these CSVs?".

 Why it exists. Three sources of run provenance already ship, and none of them is
 machine-readable:

   * `RunConfig.run_script` is a byte-for-byte copy of the script the user pointed
     at, so it contains only the fields that were *typed*. `main.jl` sets ~25 of
     the 150+ fields in the resolved config tree, and the defaults are not uniform
     (some `TsBuilderConfig` toggles default `true`, most default `false`). Reading
     it back means parsing Julia and mirroring every default.
   * `input_parameters.txt` is prose for humans, and it omits `load_factor`.
   * `Inputs/bus_data.csv` archives the *unscaled* demand — `load_system` applies
     `load_factor` after that copy is taken — so the demand actually solved cannot
     be recovered from a results folder at all without this file.

 The resolved facts that only exist inside the model (which generator the δ
 corridor was measured against, the SG/GFM partition, the time windows, which dual
 CSVs were written) are recorded in `[resolved]` and `[exports]`.

 Everything is written through `_toml_value`, so a config field added upstream
 appears here automatically: the `[run]`, `[dispatch]` and `[transient.*]` tables
 are reflected off the structs with `fieldnames`, never enumerated by hand.

# --- key and value normalisation ------------------------------------------------

# Greek field names (`δ_tol`, `Δω_tol`, `bound_style_δ`) are idiomatic in this
# codebase but hostile to attribute access on the reading side, so they are
# transliterated on the way out. `Δω` is listed before `Δ` and `ω`: `replace` takes
# the first pattern that matches at a position, so the pair maps to a single
# readable `Delta_omega` instead of `Deltaomega`.

Coerce `x` into something `TOML.print` accepts, or `nothing` when the field has no
place in the manifest (the caller then omits the key entirely).

`nothing` is returned for `Nothing` and for `Function`: an unset optional field and
a callback such as `post_solve_hook` both have no serialisable content, and TOML has
no null literal to record them with. Non-finite floats become strings because TOML
has no `inf`/`nan` — a reader that expects a number there would rather see `"Inf"`
than silently read `0.0`.

Tables: `[run]` (every `RunConfig` scalar, `load_factor` included), `[dispatch]`,
`[transient.*]`, `[resolved]` (facts only the built model knows — δ reference
machine, SG/GFM partition, machine constants, timeline, cost curve), `[exports]`

Called on every run, including failed ones: a manifest whose `[status]` records a
non-optimal termination is exactly what is needed to tell an empty results folder
apart from a converged one.

Keyword arguments are all optional so steady-state-only runs (no `dyn_model_dict`)
and pre-solve failures (no `obj_MVA`) write the tables they can fill.
