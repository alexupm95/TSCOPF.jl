# 7. Duals, KKT, and the economics

Dual variables are the language TSCOPF uses to connect optimisation algebra to market intuition. A multiplier on a power-balance row is an energy price. A multiplier on a binding generator limit is a capacity rent. A multiplier on a rotor-angle corridor is a stability scarcity signal. This page states the sign convention the code enforces, the stationarity conditions that define economic prices, and how exported CSV/XLSX columns map back to constraint families.

The coupled model is on [6. The TSC-OPF, assembled](06_tsc_opf_assembled.md). Runnable export flags and folder layout are in [Running a case — outputs](../running_a_case.md).

## JuMP Lagrangian and inequality sense

TSCOPF writes every constraint in **≤ form** for inequalities and **= 0** for equalities. JuMP's Lagrangian (simplified) is:

```math
\mathcal{L}(x, \lambda, \mu) = f(x) - \sum_i \lambda_i\, h_i(x) - \sum_j \mu_j\, g_j(x),
\qquad g_j(x) \leq 0 .
```

!!! warning "Sign convention — read this before opening a CSV"
    For an **active upper-bound** inequality coded as $(\mathrm{LHS} - \mathrm{RHS}) \leq 0$, `JuMP.dual()` returns a value **$\leq 0$**. A negative dual on $P_g \leq P_g^{\max}$ at a binding limit is correct, not a bug.

    **Economic prices use the opposite sign on balance rows:** nodal LMP $\pi_k = -\lambda_k$ on active power balance. The explicit dual LP and the primal JuMP export both follow this convention. Cross-check on case9, contingency 2, before plotting rents.

## Steady-state stationarity and LMPs

Consider a linear DCOPF (the cleanest LP case). Primal:

```math
\min \sum_g c_g P_g
\quad\text{s.t.}\quad
P_{g(k)} - \sum_m B_{km}(\theta_k - \theta_m) = P_d(k),
\quad P_g^{\min} \leq P_g \leq P_g^{\max},
\quad \ldots
```

Let $\lambda_k$ be the multiplier on balance at bus $k$, and $\underline{\eta}_g, \overline{\eta}_g$ on generator limits. Stationarity w.r.t. $P_g$ at bus $k(g)$:

!!! note "Model 7.1 (dispatch stationarity)"
    ```math
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:stationarity-pg}
    c_g + \lambda_{k(g)} - \underline{\eta}_g + \overline{\eta}_g = 0
    \end{equation}
    ```

!!! note "Interpretation (LMP decomposition)"
    Define the **economic energy price** $\pi_{k(g)} = -\lambda_{k(g)}$. Rearranging $\eqref{eq:stationarity-pg}$:

    ```math
    \pi_{k(g)} = c_g - \underline{\eta}_g + \overline{\eta}_g .
    ```

    At bus $k$, $\pi_k$ is the marginal cost of serving one more MW of load: fuel cost $c_g$ at the marginal unit, plus any capacity rent $\overline{\eta}_g$ if the upper bound binds, minus any must-run subsidy $\underline{\eta}_g$ if the lower bound binds. Congestion and angle limits enter through $\lambda_k$ indirectly when they force a re-dispatch.

ACOPF uses the same $\pi_k = -\lambda_k$ rule on the active balance rows from [2. Steady-state OPF](02_steady_state_opf.md). Reactive balance multipliers $\beta_k$ play the analogous role for reactive support scarcity.

### Two ways to obtain steady-state duals

| Mechanism | Flag | Output | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primal JuMP duals | `RunConfig.save_duals = true` | `Dispatch/CSV_duals/`, `Dispatch_Duals.xlsx` | Default; all dispatch types |
| Explicit dual LP | `dispatch.solve_explicit_dual = true` | `Dispatch_Dual/` | Linear ED or DCOPF only; strong-duality check |

The explicit LP treats prices as decision variables and recovers the same $\pi_k = -\lambda_k$ convention when strong duality holds (`test/runtests_explicit_dual.jl`).

## Transient duals are local KKT multipliers

When `trans_stab = true` and `save_duals = true`, TSCOPF exports JuMP duals from the **primal NLP** into `Transient_Stability/CSV_duals/` and `OPF_Duals_Results.xlsx`. These are multipliers on the transient constraints from [6. The TSC-OPF, assembled](06_tsc_opf_assembled.md): initial links, trapezoidal swing rows, $P_e$ definitions, COI equalities, and $\delta$ corridor inequalities.

!!! info "Assumption"
    Nonlinear TSC-ACOPF duals characterise the **specific** KKT point Ipopt converged to. They are not guaranteed to be unique global shadow prices the way an LP dual is. Use them for local sensitivity and economic interpretation at the solved trajectory, not as proof of convex market equilibrium.

### Which multipliers matter economically

| Family | Registry name | Constraint | Typical reading when binding |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial P–δ link | `dual_Pe_init` | [Model 6.1](06_tsc_opf_assembled.md) | Cost of enforcing consistency between dispatch and initial swing state |
| COI definition | `dual_δCOI` | [Model 6.6](06_tsc_opf_assembled.md) | Gauge on the inertia-weighted reference angle |
| Swing discretisation | `dual_δ`, `dual_Δω` | [Models 6.3–6.4](06_tsc_opf_assembled.md) | Shadow on integrating the swing one more step |
| Electrical power | `dual_Pe` | [Model 6.5](06_tsc_opf_assembled.md) | Network torque on the rotor at $(g,t)$ |
| **Stability corridor** | `dual_δ_COI_upper`, `dual_δ_COI_lower` | [Model 6.7](06_tsc_opf_assembled.md) | **Stability scarcity**: margin on rotor angle w.r.t. COI |
| Speed COI box (optional) | `dual_Δω_COI_upper`, `dual_Δω_COI_lower` | `constrain_Δω_COI` | Frequency-coherence scarcity |

When the upper $\delta$ bound binds for generator $g$ at time $t$, `dual_δ_COI_upper` is the incremental cost (in the Lagrangian sense) of tightening the corridor by one unit. That is the object you would trace when asking how stability constraints re-shape effective prices, not the nodal $\lambda_k$ from dispatch alone.

## Steady-state export map

Authoritative source: `src/_manage_outputs/DispatchDualRegistry.jl` (`STEADY_STATE_DUAL_SPECS`). The save layer writes only families present in the solved model.

| XLSX sheet | Constraint family | Dual / price | Id column |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P_Balance` | Active nodal balance | $\lambda_k$; LMP $= -\lambda_k$ | `Bus_ID` |
| `Q_Balance` | Reactive nodal balance | $\beta_k$ | `Bus_ID` |
| `Pg_Lo` / `Pg_Up` | Generator P limits | $\underline{\eta}_g$ / $\overline{\eta}_g$ | `Gen_ID` |
| `Qg_Lo` / `Qg_Up` | Generator Q limits | reactive bound multipliers | `Gen_ID` |
| `V_Mag_Lo` / `V_Mag_Up` | Voltage magnitude | $\alpha_k^-$ / $\alpha_k^+$ | `Bus_ID` |
| `V_Ang_Lo` / `V_Ang_Up` | Voltage angle box | $\mu_k^-$ / $\mu_k^+$ | `Bus_ID` |
| `Ang_Diff_Lo` / `Ang_Diff_Up` | Branch angle difference | $\rho_{km}^-$ / $\rho_{km}^+$ | `Branch_ID` |
| `Sik_Upper` / `Ski_Upper` | Branch thermal limits | congestion multipliers | `Branch_ID` |
| `Sg_Upper` | Gen capability curve | capability rent | `Gen_ID` |

CSV mirrors: one file per family under `Dispatch/CSV_duals/` (e.g. `dual_P_balance.csv`).

## Transient export map (classical Kron)

Authoritative source: `src/_transient_stability/DynDualRegistry.jl`, which holds **three** spec lists selected by the active path — `CLASSICAL_KRON_DUAL_SPECS` (the table below), `CLASSICAL_FULL_BUS_DUAL_SPECS` (adds nodal balance and voltage-bound families), and `DQ_4TH_FULL_BUS_DUAL_SPECS` (drops the classical-only entries and adds the two-axis machine, AVR, governor, and GFM pre-fault families). The control and converter duals — `dual_Vref_init`, `dual_avr_E_fd`, `dual_avr_E_fd_sat`, `dual_Pref_init`, `dual_gov_valve`, `dual_gov_mech`, and the limiter-specific ones — appear only on that third list. Read them alongside [8. Machine controls](08_controls_avr_governor.md) and [9. Grid-forming inverters](09_grid_forming.md), which explain what each multiplier prices.

| XLSX sheet (legacy name) | Registry export | CSV (if any) |
|---|---|---|
| `Pe_init_Duals` | `dual_Pe_init` | `dual_Pe_init.csv` |
| `delta_COI_Duals` | `dual_δCOI` | `dual_delta_COI.csv` |
| `Pe_duals` | `dual_Pe` | `dual_Pe.csv` |
| `delta_Duals` | `dual_δ` | `dual_delta.csv` |
| `Delta_Omega_Duals` | `dual_Δω` | `dual_Delta_Omega.csv` |
| `delta_COI_Lower_Duals` | `dual_δ_COI_lower` | `dual_delta_COI_lower.csv` |
| `delta_COI_Upper_Duals` | `dual_δ_COI_upper` | `dual_delta_COI_upper.csv` |

Governor and AVR paths add `dual_Pref_init`, `dual_gov_valve`, `dual_gov_mech`, `dual_gov_valve_sat` (or `dual_LB_gov_valve` / `dual_UB_gov_valve`, depending on `governor_limiter`), `dual_Vref_init`, `dual_avr_E_fd`, etc., when those constraints are built. What each of those multipliers prices is in [8. Machine controls](08_controls_avr_governor.md); the file-by-file output inventory is in [Dynamic controls (AVR / governor)](../dynamic_controls_avr_governor.md).

**CSV export is registry-driven.** Every entry in the catalog that declares a `csv_file` and whose constraint family exists in the run is written to `Transient_Stability/CSV_duals/`. Adding a `DualRegistryEntry` is the only step needed to export a new family — the save layer needs no edit. That includes the optional variable-bound duals (`dual_LB_Ed`, `dual_UB_V_ref`, `dual_LB_Pv`, …), which appear as soon as the matching `TsBuilderConfig.bound_*` toggle builds the ≤-row.

## Worked reading (9-bus, contingency 2)

!!! tip "Example 7.1 · tracing a binding stability dual"
    Run the Kron TSC-ACOPF example from [6. The TSC-OPF, assembled](06_tsc_opf_assembled.md) with `δ_tol_deg = 120` and `save_duals = true`. After a successful solve:

    1. Open `RESULTS/Results - <timestamp>/Dispatch/Dispatch_Duals.xlsx` and note $\lambda_k$ on the marginal buses (LMP $= -\lambda_k$).
    2. Open `Transient_Stability/OPF_Duals_Results.xlsx` → `delta_COI_Upper_Duals`. Find generator 2 in the fault window; a non-zero entry means the upper $\delta$ corridor bound was active at that time step.
    3. Compare magnitude and sign with `Transient_Stability/CSV_duals/dual_delta_COI_upper.csv` (same registry row).

    If you enable `dispatch.solve_explicit_dual = true` on a **dispatch-only** linear DCOPF of the same case, $\pi_k$ from `Dispatch_Dual/` should match $-\lambda_k$ from the primal dispatch duals on balance rows (up to solver tolerance).
